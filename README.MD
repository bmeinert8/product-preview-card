## Overview

The Product Preview Page is a beautifully designed and responsive web application that originated as a challenge from Frontend Mentor. Upon completing the initial design, I enhanced the page by implementing additional functionalities, including displaying the cart quantity, a button to reset the cart quantity, and functionality to the "Add to Cart" button to update the cart quantity. The cart quantity information is stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive and adjusts its layout based on the screen size.
- **Product Preview**: Displays a picture of the product along with its information and price.
- **Cart Functionality**: Ability to add prodcut to cart, display the cart quantity, and reset the cart.
